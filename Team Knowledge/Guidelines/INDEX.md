# Guidelines - Index

**Guidelines are general rules every agent reads on every relevant action.** Where SOPs are skills (procedures the agent runs) and Workstreams are compositions (multi-agent choreography), Guidelines are the static rules and constraints that hold the whole system together. Naming, frontmatter, design system. SOPs and Workstreams `[[wikilink]]` to Guidelines rather than duplicating the rules.

Filename pattern: `GL-NNN-<title>.md`.

## Active Guidelines

| GL | Title | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GL-001 | [[GL-001-file-naming-conventions]] | Kebab-case rules, ISO date prefix on date-driven files, slug rules, image filename pattern. |
| GL-002 | [[GL-002-frontmatter-conventions]] | YAML frontmatter field schemas for all 8 entity types, typing rules, foreign-key convention. Aligns with [[SOP-002-convert-mypka-to-sqlite]]. |
| GL-003 | [[GL-003-design-system]] | Design-system / visual-identity SSOT — color, type, spacing, voice tokens that Iris authors and Charta/Pixel/Vera read from. *(Designer Pack — preinstalled in v3.0.0)* |
| GL-004 | [[GL-004-task-resource-linking]] | One-way Task → Resource linking rule, seven-array task frontmatter contract, `linked_deliverables` slug format, archive-on-close cascade. Read by [[SOP-create-task]], [[SOP-claim-task]], [[SOP-close-task]]. |

*Reserved:* none — GL-003 is now filled by the Designer Pack preinstalled in the v3.0.0 all-in-one bundle. Next free Guideline slot is GL-005.

## When to write a new Guideline

- The rule is static and applies across many files or procedures.
- More than one SOP or Workstream needs to know about it.
- Without it, you would copy-paste the same rule into multiple files.

If you find yourself restating the same rule in two files, stop and write a Guideline. Then `[[wikilink]]` to it from both files.
